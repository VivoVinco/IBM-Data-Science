This video shows you how to try out IBM
Watson for free. IBM Watson gives you access to IBM
Watson Studio, IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog, the data refinery, machine and
deep learning, visual recognition models, dashboards and streams flows. At https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/ you can sign up for a free trial.  When
you sign up for an IBM Watson account you are automatically signed up for a
free IBM Cloud account. Here you see the Watson applications that will be
provisioned. IBM Watson Studio and IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog.
If you already have an IBM cloud account then use your IBM ID to sign up for IBM Watson. Otherwise, type your email address which
will be used to create an IBM cloud account for you.
On the next screen you are redirected to the IBM cloud registration page where
you need to provide the typical basic information for an account then click
create account. Now check your email and confirm your
account. Now that you've registered for IBM cloud
you can use those same credentials to sign-in.
Next you'll see the process create the IBM Watson user account using your IBM
cloud credentials and finally you'll see that your account was successfully
created. This IBM account has only one Associated IBM cloud account and one resource group. If you have more than one associated
account or one account with multiple resource groups then during the Watson
Studio account setup you'll see this screen giving you the option to select
an account and resource group to use. IBM Cloud uses resource groups as a way for you to organize your account resources in customizable groupings so that you
can quickly assign users access to more than one resource at a time.

provisioned. Now you're ready to start working in IBM Watson.
