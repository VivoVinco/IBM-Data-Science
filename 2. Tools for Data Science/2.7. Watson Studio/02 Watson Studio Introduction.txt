Watson Studio is an integrated
platform of tools services and data that helps companies accelerate their shift
to become data-driven organizations you can start with a free account to explore
its capabilities data science is a team sport we have different types of people
interested in the insights that data science can provide this includes
business analysts data engineers data stewards data scientist and developers
data needs to be located in cleanse models have to be created tested
monitored and updated all this requires teamwork
for this reason watson city was built as a collaborative platform a community of
like-minded people there is a lot to cover in this introduction and will only
scratch the surface you can find more information on the digital technical
engagement site at ibm.com slash demos once you are logged in you may see the
get started welcome screen you can minimize the screen by clicking on the
get started button in the upper right one important item that is easy to miss
is the hamburger button in the upper left it gives you direct access to
projects catalogs and services among other things the gallery is particularly
interesting it is a collection of assets including tutorials notebooks datasets
articles and papers from multiple sources new assets are constantly added
assets can be searched using filters for Thai language technology topics and so
on the results can be sorted by features or by date manage gives you quick access
to specific areas to manage finally we have integrated support and
documentation in the Watson environment as mentioned earlier the project is the
center of the collaboration it is very simple to create a project you click
create a project in the welcome screen or new project
and either create an empty project or one from an existing one then you give
it a name possibly add a description and you're ready to go at the project level
we also have a menu of options it starts with the overview where you can see
basic information on the project this tab also includes a readme section where
you can get more details on what the project is about the next one is assets
where you can see the data assets models notebooks and other assets that are part
of the project you can go to add specific assets using the add to project
drop down menu at the top of the screen we won't go into all of those menu items
but one important want to know is connection this allows you to access
data that comes from outside Watson studio as you can see it includes a lot
of data services from IBM but also quite a few from third parties such as Amazon
and Microsoft going back to our project I'd like to point out the environment
section one important tool for that exploration data manipulation and model
creation is the notebook depending on the amount of work that needs to be done
we have a choice of resource allocation we can also tailor the environment to
include additional libraries so we have a complete environment from the start I
want to point out two more selections from the top menu access control and
settings the access control allows you to control collaborators and their
permissions and more in the settings section you can among other things add
services for example you click on the add service drop-down menu select Watson
and add a machine-learning service you have the choice to add an existing
service you may have created earlier in another project or create a new one note
that most services include a light free version this means that you can
experiment with all sorts of capabilities for free you
