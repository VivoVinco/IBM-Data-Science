The languages of Data Science For anyone just getting started on their data
science journey, the range of technical options can be overwhelming. There is a dizzying amount
of choice when it comes to programming languages. Each has it's own strengths and weaknesses
and there is no one right answer to the question of which one you should learn first. The answer
to that question depends largely on your needs, the problems you are trying to solve, and
who you are solving them for. Python, R, and SQL are the languages that
we recommend you consider first and foremost. But there are so many others that have their
own strengths and features. Scala, Java, C++, and Julia are some of the
most popular. Javascript, PHP, Go, Ruby, and Visual Basic
all have their own unique use cases as well. The language you choose to learn will depend
on the things you need to accomplish and the problems you need to solve. It will also depend
on what company you work for, what role you have, and the age of your existing application.
We’ll explore the answers to this question as we dive into the popular languages in the
data science industry. There are many roles available for people
who are interested in getting involved in data science.
Business Analyst Database Engineer
Data Analyst Data Engineer
Data Scientist Research Scientist
Software Engineer Statistician
Product Manager Project Manager
and many more. Let’s dive into what we will learn in Lesson
1. We will put most of our focus on the top three Data Science languages: Python, R, and
SQL, which each have their own lessons. Then we will go on to highlight other noteworthy
languages and what makes them special. Then we’ll finish with a short quiz to test your
knowledge! ● 1.1.1 - Python
