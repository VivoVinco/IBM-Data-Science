One of the main strengths of R is not very
nice looking syntax of course, it’s the abundance of packages. So if you go to cran.r-project.org, this is
The Comprehensive R Archive Network. You have a link here for packages and you
see here table of available packages. You can also sort by date or name, so you
get around 15,349 packages. And that’s a lot so I’m audio guy. So lets have a look over here for audio. So there’s and audio package. If you want to install such a package in R,
its pretty straightforward. What you need to do is you say, ‘install.packages’
and then you say the name of the package, ‘audio’ and then you just execute. It asks me whether I want to compile it from
source, this is fine. So a lot of the R packages are written C or
C++ so you need to have a C compiler installed, and then the package is compiled on your machine
for you. So this is done, in order to use the package
you need to load it. Say library or you can also say require, it
doesn’t matter and then you say audio. So now the package is loaded and you see that
also here, that the audio package is now loaded. And now you can use it. So, if you want to have a look at the source
code or some examples, you can just drill down from the R archive. So I’m going here to this URL, and you see
here it’s a little example. So this should play a sine wave, lets actually
have a look whether I can connect to my microphone with my speaker. If that works, ok can you hear that? Ok so that is an example how easy it is to
install and use packages in R. And the problem is not that you wont find a package for a
specific task, the problem is more that you have five or ten different packages for a
specific task. And you need to read a lot and decide which
one you are using. So in the next video I will, how to plot in
R studio usning ggplot.
