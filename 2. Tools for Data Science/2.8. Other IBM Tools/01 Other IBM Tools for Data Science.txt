In this video, we will look at several other IBM tools that help data scientists in
their day to day work. Watson Knowledge Catalog
helps data scientists to catalog and manage all
their data resources. Data refinery provides
graphical tools for analyzing and preparing data. SPSS based products include easy to use graphical
interfaces for wide varieties of statistical and machine
learning algorithms and data transformations. We will talk about approaches
to model deployment, including open standards and
Watson Machine Learning. Newer features of
Watson Studio include AutoAI that
automatically computes the best data pipeline and Watson OpenScale
which helps to ensure fairness and explainability
of the models.
