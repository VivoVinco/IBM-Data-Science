Hello and welcome. In this video, we'll go over SQL functions built into the database for dates and times. So let's get started. Most databases contain special data types for dates and times. Db2 contains date, time, and timestamp types. In Db2, date has eight digits: for year, month, and day. Time has six digits: hours, minutes, and seconds. Timestamp has 20 digits: year, month, day, hour, minute, seconds, and microseconds where double X represents the month and six Z's or Z represents microseconds. Functions exist to extract the day, month, day of month, day of week, day of year, week, hour, minute, and second. Let's look at some examples of queries for date and time functions. The day function can be used to extract the day portion from a date. For example, get the day portion for each sale date involving cat- is shown as, select DAY (SALEDATE) from PETSALE where ANIMAL equals cat. Date and time functions can be used in the where clause. For example, get the number of sales during the month of May, ie from Month 5- is shown as, select COUNT star from PETSALE where MONTH (SALEDATE) equals 05. You can also perform date or time arithmetic. For example, let's say you wanted to know what the date was three days after each sale date because each order needs to be processed within three days. The query would be, what date is it three days after each sale date? And would be shown as, select (SALEDATE plus three DAYS) from PETSALE. Special registers for current time and current date are also available. For example, find how many days have passed since each sale date till now- is shown as, select (CURRENT_DATE minus SALEDATE) from PETSALE. The sample result is shown here. In this video, we looked at different types of built in SQL functions namely date, time functions. Thanks for watching.
